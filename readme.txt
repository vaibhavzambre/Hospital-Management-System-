Hospital Management System
Overview
The Hospital Management System is a simple console-based application implemented in C++. It provides basic functionalities for managing patient records, including adding new records, adding prescription details, displaying full patient history, deleting patient records, and updating patient information.

Features
Add New Patient Record: Allows the user (doctor) to input details such as patient ID, name, age, gender, blood group, contact information, past history, and address. The system maintains a linked list of patient records.

Add Patient Prescription: Enables the doctor to diagnose a patient by adding symptoms, diagnosis, prescribed medicines, and indicating whether admission to the hospital is required.

Full History of the Patient: Displays the complete history of a patient based on their ID, including personal details, past history, and, if diagnosed, the prescribed treatment.

Delete Patient Record: Allows the removal of a patient record from the system based on the patient's ID. This action also updates the internal data structure accordingly.

Update Patient Record: Enables the doctor to modify patient information. The system provides a menu with options to update specific details such as name, age, gender, contact information, address, and prescription details.

How to Use

Follow the prompts to input or retrieve patient information.
For adding prescriptions, ensure that the patient ID is correctly entered, and the system will prompt for symptoms, diagnosis, prescribed medicines, and admission details.
